# Drone-SWAAN-Intelligent-Multi-Drone-Task-Allocation-using-Ant-Colony-Optimization
Project uses grid-based graph traversal for multi-drone navigation, Ant Colony Optimization for shortest pathfinding, node-based movement, and heap logic for task prioritization. DSA concepts include graphs, paths, grids, and search optimization with real-time dynamic updates.
